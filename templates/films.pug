                            p(class="description text") This is a short film that I made with friends for a film competition. Unfortunately, the original film idea couldn't be filmed so we ended up with this 4 minute clip which I cut into a trailer. The intro was made in Affter Effects and all of the other graphics were made in Photoshop.

                            p(class="description text") Okay, this is the film that I made with my Black Magic Camera. I happen to capture this hilarious family moment on video and thought  it would make a great silent film. The footage was edited in Adobe Premier and the tile cards were created in Adobe Photoshp.
