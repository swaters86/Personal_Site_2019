                            p(class="description text") This is a short film that I made with friends for a film competition. We had 2 weeks to film, but we were actually limited to a weekend because of our day time jobs. Unfortnately, the original film we were going to film didn't fall-through so we ended with a 4 minute clip that we filmed at the last minute (we decieded to just have fun filmming it during the day of the shoot and dimiss the idea of winning an award that day!) which I cut into a trailer. The intro was made in Affter Effects and all of the other graphics were made in Photoshop.

                            p(class="description text") One of my friends needed help making a real estate video so I helped him by filming inside of the house with a stabilizer and then editing the footage in Adobe Premier.

                            p(class="description text") This is one of the first films I edited. My friend had this silly idea for a commercial and I went along by helping him film it with my black magic camera and started in it as the "bed head" guy. I then edited it in Adobe Premier. I synced up the airline ding sound effect with the light turning on because I wanted to make the short film more interesting.

                            h2(class="title is-2") Zoominations Videography
                            p(class="description text") I filmed an event called Zoominations because I realized that the event would be perfect for night-time filmmaking. I edited the footage and translated the credits into Chinese by using Google Translate.
